# Divide-and-Conquer

Divide and Conquer technique of solving problems apply 3 steps.

## Divide
The problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

## Conquer
The subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.

## Combine
The solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
